            <p class="aboutmetext">Hello I'm Rey Coronado. My background is in business operations development and I have had the pleasure of working with several startups over the years. From manufacturing to tech, I've seen the rollercoaster that is the startup world.
            I hope to develop myself as a developer to become more knowledgeable in business and also to develop platforms and applications myself.</p>
